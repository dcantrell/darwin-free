HOMEBREW:

   A Homebrew formula is available at https://github.com/nickolasburr/homebrew-pfa.
   To install via Homebrew, run the following:

   brew tap nickolasburr/pfa
   brew install darwin-free

COMPILATION:

   You need a compiler, some headers, and a Mach-based system.  On Darwin,
   you can type make:

      make

   And out will pop a 'free' executable.  On other systems, it may require
   modification of the Makefile and/or source.

INSTALLATION:

   Either run 'make install' or put the free executable in a public place
   and the man page in a sensible place.

USAGE:

   See free(1).

NOTES:

   This utility is designed to act like 'free' on Linux systems.  It is a
   tool for displaying memory usage statistics.  Since the Mach microkernel
   design is different than Linux, the values reported are not an exact
   duplicate of what you can get from a Linux system.  Be sure to read the
   man page for an explanation of the program output.
